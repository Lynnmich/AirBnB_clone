AirBnB Clone

The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

The complete web application will be composed of:

-A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

-A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

-A database or files that store data (data = objects)

-An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)


Concepts to learn
-Unittest - and please work all together on tests cases
-Python packages concept page
-Serialization/Deserialization
-*args, **kwargs
-datetime


Steps
Each step will link to a concept:

1. The console
-create your data model
-manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

2. Web static
-learn HTML/CSS
-create the HTML of your application
-create template of each object

3. MySQL storage
-replace the file storage by a Database storage
-map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

4. Web framework - templating
-create your first web server in Python
-make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

5. RESTful API
-expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
-manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

6. Web dynamic
-learn JQuery
-load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API
